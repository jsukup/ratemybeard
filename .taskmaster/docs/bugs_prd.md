# Overview

RateMyFeet currently has several critical bugs and performance issues that affect user experience, data integrity, and system reliability. This PRD identifies and prioritizes 15 major bugs across the rating system, database operations, UI components, and infrastructure that need immediate attention.

The bugs range from critical data inconsistency issues (inverted percentile calculations) to performance bottlenecks (inefficient database queries) and user experience problems (session ID mismatches preventing proper duplicate detection).

# Core Issues

## Critical Data Integrity Bugs
- **Session ID Inconsistency**: Different session key naming across components breaks duplicate rating prevention
- **Inverted Percentile Logic**: Category assignments are backwards, showing lowest-rated content in top tier
- **Rating Statistics Sync Issues**: Statistics updates can fail silently, causing data inconsistency

## Performance Bottlenecks  
- **Inefficient Database Queries**: Rate limiting and leaderboard queries lack optimization
- **Memory Overload**: Entire datasets loaded into memory for sorting operations
- **Synchronous Operations**: Statistics updates block API responses unnecessarily

## User Experience Problems
- **Poor Error Handling**: Database errors often result in silent failures or incorrect behavior
- **Missing Validation**: Insufficient input validation allows invalid data submission
- **Confusing UI States**: Rating buttons show values even when disabled

# User Experience

## Current User Pain Points
- Users may accidentally submit duplicate ratings due to session management bugs
- Leaderboard shows incorrect rankings due to percentile calculation errors
- Rating submissions sometimes appear to succeed but fail silently
- Page performance degrades significantly with large datasets
- Mobile users experience slower loading times due to inefficient queries

## Target User Experience
- Reliable duplicate prevention across all devices and sessions
- Accurate leaderboard rankings that reflect actual user ratings
- Clear feedback on rating submission success/failure states
- Fast, responsive interface even with large amounts of data
- Consistent performance across desktop and mobile platforms
