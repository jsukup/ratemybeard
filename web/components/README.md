# WebcamCapture Components

This directory contains multiple implementations of the WebcamCapture component:

## WebcamCapture.tsx

This is the main implementation that's used in the application. It's currently a simple wrapper around `WebcamCaptureSimple` to ensure compatibility with React 18.2.0.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import WebcamCaptureSimple from "./WebcamCaptureSimple";

export default function WebcamCapture({ onImageCapture }) {
  // This is now just a wrapper around the simplified version
  return <WebcamCaptureSimple onImageCapture={onImageCapture} />;
}
```

## WebcamCaptureSimple.tsx

A simplified implementation that doesn't use the `react-webcam` library, which has compatibility issues with React 18.2.0. This component provides a basic placeholder UI and simulates photo capture functionality.

## WebcamCaptureOriginal.tsx

This file preserves the original, feature-rich implementation that uses the `react-webcam` library. It includes advanced features like:

- Face detection
- Auto-capture
- Camera device selection
- Mobile device support
- Countdown timer
- Visual feedback

**Note:** This implementation is not currently used in the application due to compatibility issues with React 18.2.0. It's preserved for reference and can be reintegrated once the compatibility issues are resolved, either by:

1. Upgrading to React 19+ where the compatibility issues are fixed
2. Finding a compatible version of `react-webcam` that works with React 18.2.0
3. Refactoring the component to use a different webcam library

## Compatibility Issues

The original implementation uses the `react-webcam` library, which has type compatibility issues with React 18.2.0. Specifically, the error is:

```
JSX element class does not support attributes because it does not have a 'props' property.
'Webcam' cannot be used as a JSX component.
```

This is a known issue with certain component libraries when used with React 18.2.0.
